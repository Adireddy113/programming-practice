# Access Modifiers in PHP

This mini project demonstrates the basics of **access modifiers** in PHP.  
It is part of my practice while learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).


## What It Covers

- what are access modifiers and types
- How to define them and why to use them
- usage of access modifiers
- Creating objects using the `new` keyword
- Accessing properties and calling methods

## Shortcodes
- `access_modifiers`


## what i learned from mistakes

- Access modifiers **public**,**private** and **protected** are meaningful when used outside the class
- we can access all properties and methods inside the class whether any type of access modifiers
