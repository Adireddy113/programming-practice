# Properties and Methods in PHP

This repo is a beginner-friendly practice project to understand how **properties** and **methods** work in PHP classes.


## What Youâ€™ll Learn

- How to define properties (variables) inside a class  
- How to write and use methods (functions inside a class)  
- How to interact with properties using the `$this` keyword  
- Basic real-world simulation: product price and discount


## Example: Product Class

The class contains:
- `name` and `price` as properties  
- `productDetails()` to show product info  
- `giveDiscount()` to calculate final price


##  Why?

Practicing these concepts helps build a strong foundation in **Object-Oriented Programming** before moving on to more advanced topics like inheritance and polymorphism.
