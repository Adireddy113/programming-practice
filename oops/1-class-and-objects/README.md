# Classes and Objects in PHP

This mini project demonstrates the basics of **classes and objects** in PHP.  
It is part of my practice while learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).


## What It Covers

- Creating a PHP class
- Adding properties (like name, price)
- Writing methods (functions inside a class)
- Creating objects using the `new` keyword
- Accessing properties and calling methods

## Shortcodes
- `class_object`
- `claci`


## Goal

Learning how to use **OOP** concepts starting from **class and object** â€” the building blocks of any object-oriented program.
