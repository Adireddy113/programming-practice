# ðŸ”· Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Practice â€“ PHP

This repository is dedicated to learning and practicing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** using **PHP**.  
Each file or folder inside demonstrates a specific concept with simple examples, helps me master core programming fundamentals and improve my coding logic.

## ðŸ“š What Iâ€™m Learning

- âœ… Classes and Objects  
- âœ… Properties and Methods  
- âœ… Constructors and Destructors  
- âœ… Access Modifiers (public, private, protected)  
- âœ… Inheritance  
- âœ… Method Overriding  
- âœ… Static Methods and Properties  
- âœ… Interfaces and Abstract Classes  
- âœ… Traits  
- âœ… Magic Methods (`__construct`, `__get`, `__set`, etc.)  
- âœ… Real-world Examples


## ðŸ“Œ Goal

Iâ€™m currently a B.Tech final year student preparing for:

- ðŸŽ¯ Web development (WordPress)
- ðŸŽ¯ High-paying fresher roles
- ðŸŽ¯ Strong programming foundation

This OOP practice helps me understand **how real applications are structured** and prepares me to build scalable, modular PHP/WordPress projects.
