# Logger Trait Example

This is a simple PHP example demonstrating how to use a **single trait** across multiple classes. It shows how traits help **reuse functionality** without duplicating code.


## Features

* A **LoggerTrait** that contains a reusable logging method.
* Two classes (`Question` and `User`) that **use the trait**.
* Each class can **log actions** without rewriting the same code.
* Clean and simple structure suitable for learning OOP in PHP.


## Why Traits?

* **Avoid code duplication** across multiple classes.
* **Reusable functionality** without relying on inheritance.
* Easy to maintain and scale as your project grows.
