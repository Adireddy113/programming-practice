# 🛠️ Practice Playground: OOP, DSA, and Web Development

Welcome to my learning repository! 👨‍💻  
This is where I practice and showcase concepts from:

- ✅ **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – PHP examples, real-world mini projects, and method-based learning.
- ✅ **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** – Core logic building and coding for campus placements.
- ✅ **Frontend Web Development** – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript exercises.
- ✅ **Backend Development** – PHP-based logic and WordPress plugins.


## 📂 Folder Structure

| Folder / File            | Description                                 |

| `dsa/`                   | DSA topics like arrays, stacks, sorting, etc. |
| `html-css-js/`           | Mini projects and examples using HTML/CSS/JS |
| `wp-plugins/`            | WordPress plugin experiments (shortcodes, forms, CPTs) |



## 🔥 Why This Repo?

I’m currently in my B.Tech final year and working towards becoming a high-paying **WordPress developer**.  
This repo helps me stay consistent and build real, useful code that I can later converts into:

- ✅ WordPress projects
- ✅ GitHub portfolio
- ✅ Campus placement preparation



## 🧠 Key Focus Areas

- Understanding **OOP** through real examples (no boring theory)
- Practicing **DSA** with questions & logic breakdowns
- Building **interactive UIs** with HTML, CSS, JS
- Exploring **WordPress development** with custom plugins



## 🚀 Technologies Used

- PHP
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- WordPress Plugin Development
- Git + GitHub
