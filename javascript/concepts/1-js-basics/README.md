# JavaScript Basics

This folder contains **basic JavaScript concepts and examples** for learning purposes.  
It is designed to help you understand the fundamentals of JavaScript.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- **Variables** â€“ `var`, `let`, `const`  
- **Data Types** â€“ Primitive(`str`,`number`,`null`,`boolean`,`undefined`,`symbol`...) Reference(`object`,`array`,`function`)
- **Type Conversion** and `typeof` to check type.
- **Console Output** - `console.log`

## ðŸš€ Interview Questions

1. Variable Scope & Hoisting - let and const are strict so they must declare before use ,if not(Reference Error) and both are hoisted, not initialised, lives in TDZ(Temporal Dead Zone ) until declaration. But var is hoisted and initialised to "undefined" so it can be accessed before declaration.

2. Type Conversion - "+" with string happens concatination otherwise it try do operations. if u do other ops with string like ("5"-3) it will try to convert string to value and return result. In same way ("abc"-3) it will return NaN(not a number) as it able to convert the string to num

3. Object Mutation - even tough using const the arrays and objects are mutable because it locks `references` not content. so u can add new keys or change values. It prevents only reassignment of variables.

4. == vs === - "==" checks only data "===" checks data and its type.

5. undefined and null are different types

6. NaN is only the value in js , not equal to itself

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Open the relevant JS file for the topic you want to learn.  
2. Run it in the browser console or Node.js environment.  
3. Experiment with variations to reinforce your understanding.  
4. Add your own small exercises for practice.
