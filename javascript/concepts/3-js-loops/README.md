## ðŸš€ Interview Questions

1. infinite loop trap (no i++)

2. Function scoped - a var is function scoped if its only accessible inside the function. using "var" keyword. Declared inside loop or if still accessible. Like for(var i = 1) . Block SCOPED - Accessible within block it was declared in. using "let" or "const". Dissapear outside block(Reference error)

3. for...of(arrays, strings) - Prints values . for...in(objects) - prints indexes

5. continue is used when u want to skip the iteration at certain condition

6. Nested loops quirk

7. while vs do while
