# JavaScript Development Repository

Welcome to the **JavaScript repository**!  
This folder serves as the main hub for all **JavaScript concepts and practice tasks**.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The `JavaScript/` folder is organized into two main sections:

### **1. JS-Concepts/**
Contains examples, notes, and experiments to understand core JavaScript concepts, including:
- Basics (variables, operators, loops, functions)
- DOM Manipulation
- ES6 features (arrow functions, classes, modules, destructuring)
- Asynchronous programming (callbacks, promises, async/await)

### **2. JS-Tasks/**
Contains hands-on exercises and mini-projects to apply JavaScript concepts practically, including:
- DOM manipulation tasks
- ES6 coding exercises
- Asynchronous API calls
- Small projects combining multiple JS concepts

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Navigate to the folder you want to explore: `JS-Concepts` for theory, `JS-Tasks` for practice.  
2. Open JS files in your browser console or Node.js environment to run and test code.  
3. Modify examples, experiment with variations, and add new tasks as you learn.  
4. Commit daily exercises to track your progress.

## ðŸ’¡ Goal

- Learn and master JavaScript concepts thoroughly.  
- Apply knowledge in real-world mini-projects.  
- Build a structured, professional repository for learning and portfolio purposes.
