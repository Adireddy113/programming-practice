# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Repository

Welcome to the **DSA repository**!  
This folder serves as the main hub for learning and practicing **Data Structures and Algorithms** concepts.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The `DSA/` folder is organized into the following sections:

### **Subfolders**
- **Arrays/** â€“ Array operations, searching, sorting, and practice problems  
- **LinkedLists/** â€“ Single, double, and circular linked lists with exercises  
- **Stacks-Queues/** â€“ Stack and queue implementation and applications  
- **Trees/** â€“ Binary trees, BST, tree traversals, and practice problems  
- **Graphs/** â€“ Graph representations, traversals (BFS/DFS), and graph algorithms  

*Daily updates:* New exercises and problems will be added regularly.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Open the subfolder for the topic you want to practice.  
2. Run the code in your preferred programming environment (PHP, Python, or JS).  
3. Modify examples, implement variations, and add your own practice problems.  
4. Track your progress by committing daily exercises.

## ðŸ’¡ Goal

- Understand and master core DSA concepts.  
- Solve real-world coding problems and practice for interviews.  
- Build a structured and professional repository for reference and portfolio purposes.
