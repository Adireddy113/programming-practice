# ðŸ§  DSA Practice â€“ My Learning Journey in PHP

This folder contains my personal practice problems for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using PHP. I'm actively learning and exploring different concepts to improve my coding skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## âœ… What Iâ€™m Practicing

Iâ€™m working through a variety of DSA topics, including:

- Arrays (traversal, merging, reversing, frequency counting)  
- Strings (manipulation, pattern matching)  
- Sorting algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, etc.)  
- Searching techniques (Linear, Binary)  
- Recursion basics  
- Stack and Queue implementations  
- Hash maps and associative arrays  
- Problem-solving with loops and conditions

## ðŸ“˜ What Iâ€™ve Learned So Far

As I solve these problems, Iâ€™m getting better at:

- Writing clean and structured PHP code  
- Understanding how different data structures work  
- Applying logic to solve real-world problems  
- Preparing for coding rounds and interviews  
- Thinking step-by-step and debugging effectively

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Iâ€™m Doing This

Iâ€™m preparing for tech roles like **WordPress Developer** and **Fullstack Developer**, and I want to build a strong foundation in DSA. Practicing these problems helps me:

- Improve my problem-solving mindset  
- Get comfortable with PHP syntax and logic  
- Build confidence for technical assessments

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Next

Iâ€™ll keep adding more problems and topics as I learn, including:

- Linked lists  
- Trees and graphs  
- Dynamic programming  
- More advanced recursion  
- Real-world coding challenges


This folder is part of my learning journey.
