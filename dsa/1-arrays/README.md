# PHP Array Practice â€“ Just Learning and Exploring
  
This is a small PHP project I worked on while practicing basic array problems.

## âœ… Problems I Practiced

- Indexed array traversal  
- Associative array formatting  
- Merging arrays and removing duplicates  
- Reversing arrays manually  
- Counting frequency of elements

## ðŸ“˜ Topics I Learned

While working on these problems, I got more comfortable with:

- `foreach` loops and array manipulation  
- Using conditions like `if`, `isset`, and flags  
- String formatting with `implode()`  
- Two-pointer logic for reversing arrays  
- Basic hash map-style counting using associative arrays  
- Structuring code inside a class for better organization

## ðŸŽ¯ Why I Did This

Iâ€™m currently learning PHP and preparing for tech roles like WordPress Developer and Fullstack Developer. This practice helped me understand how arrays work and how to apply basic logic to solve problems.


## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Next

I plan to keep learning and add more problems soon, like:

- Sorting algorithms  
- Searching techniques  
- Stack and queue examples  
- Recursion basics


This repo is just part of my learning journey.
